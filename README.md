# Heart-Disease-Predictor
Heart Disease Predictor is a simple machine learning model that is designed to predict the likelihood of a patient having heart disease based on various input features.

The Heart Disease Predictor is typically trained on a large dataset of patient records, which includes features such as age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and other relevant medical information. The model uses this data to learn patterns and relationships that can help predict the likelihood of heart disease in new patients.

Once the model is trained, it can take input data on a new patient and output a prediction of their likelihood of having heart disease. This information can be used by doctors and medical professionals to make more informed decisions about patient care and treatment.

Heart Disease Predictor can be a valuable tool in healthcare settings, helping to identify patients who are at high risk for heart disease and enabling early intervention and treatment. By using machine learning algorithms to analyze large amounts of medical data, Heart Disease Predictor can provide accurate and timely predictions that can improve patient outcomes and save lives.

# Data Descrpition
Using this medical dataset,related to cardiovascular disease. Each row represents a patient, and each column represents a different attribute of the patient. Here's what each attribute means:

    age: the age of the patient in years
    sex: the biological sex of the patient (1 for male, 0 for female)
    cp: chest pain type (1 for typical angina, 2 for atypical angina, 3 for non-anginal pain, 4 for asymptomatic)
    trestbps: resting blood pressure (in mm Hg) upon admission to the hospital
    chol: serum cholesterol level (in mg/dl)
    fbs: fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (1 for true, 0 for false)
    restecg: resting electrocardiographic results (0 for normal, 1 for having ST-T wave abnormality, 2 for showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes' criteria)
    thalach: maximum heart rate achieved during exercise
    exang: exercise induced angina (1 for yes, 0 for no)
    oldpeak: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
    slope: the slope of the peak exercise ST segment (1 for upsloping, 2 for flat, 3 for downsloping)
    ca: number of major vessels (0-3) colored by fluoroscopy
    thal: a blood disorder called thalassemia (3 for normal, 6 for fixed defect, 7 for reversable defect)
    target: presence of heart disease (1 for yes, 0 for no)
